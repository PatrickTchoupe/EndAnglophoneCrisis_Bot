### EndAnglophoneCrisis_Bot

This is a simple Twitter bot that retweets and likes tweets made on the EndAnglophoneCrisis hashtag.

This hashtag was created to inform the international community and the general public about the crisis in the English-speaking part of Cameroon.

The goal of the bot is to generate more activity on the # so that it will have a twittering tendency, hoping that a solution will be found to this crisis which has been going on for 4 years.
